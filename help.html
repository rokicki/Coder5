Coder5 leverages the power of JavaScript and HTML5 to create a
programming environment in the spirit of the microcomputes from
the 70's.  Based on the idea that anyone can learn to program,
it includes numerous small examples that anyone can modify and
learn from, extend, and turn into full-featured HTML5
applications that run on phones, tablets, and desktops
everywhere.

Coder5 can be used to learn the fundamentals of JavaScript,
to create simple animations using Canvas, or to try out
simple ideas in your browser.  It works online or offline;
all your code is stored in the browser's localStorage so
it stays with you wherever you are.

We intend to create a basic facility for sharing code so
everyone can learn from everyone else and so the set of
examples continues to increase.
